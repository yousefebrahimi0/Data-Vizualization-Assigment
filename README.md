# Data-Vizualization-Assigment
The purpose of this report is to outline the use of visualization concepts and techniques in transforming data into a meaningful interactive visualization, as required by the objective of the project assigned to our group. Our project was implemented through data
exploration with Python and Plotly, and visualization/story using Tableau software. We made sure to frame it using the data visualization techniques and concepts explored during the course. Our goal was to create a visualization that matched our professional/academic interests while meeting the project requirements. The users of this dashboard get different types of interactivities, such as filtering by regions/states, time, and sites, as well as parameters for the previous and present years.
